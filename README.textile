h2. About BlankStatic

BlankStatic is "Firsthand Web Design's":http://www.firsthand.ca starter template for developing static websites and prototyping templates for web applications or for "Radiant CMS":http://www.radiantcms.org. It uses "StaticMatic":http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org/ which serves and builds HTML and CSS from "Haml":http://haml-lang.com/ and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/.

BlankStatic adds a set of HAML and Sass templates to the default template generated by StaticMatic. It is configured to use "Compass"::http://www.github.com/chriseppstein/compass  with "Blueprint CSS":http://www.blueprintcss.org/.

The Haml and Sass templates include:

* a set of standard pages such as index, 404 and 505 error pages
* a "basic" page layout for styling headers, paragraphs, tables, and forms
* a default layout of stylesheet partials
* a default grid and layout for pages based on Blueprint CSS
* sample styles for drop-down CSS menus and others

It also captures good practices in meta tags and Javascript placement.

h2. Getting Started

You will probably want to add this as a remote repository rather than cloning and overwriting this one. So start off creating your own repository first, then add this as a remote.

<pre>
  $ mkdir /path/to/my_project
  $ cd /path/to/my_project
  $ git init
  $ git remote add blank-static git://github.com/firsthand/blank-static.git
  $ git fetch blank-static
  $ git merge blank-static/master
</pre>

Since blank-static uses "Bundler":http://gembundler.com/ install the dependent gems is easy.

<pre>
  $ (sudo) gem install bundler # if you don't have it installed already
  $ (sudo) bundle install
  $ bin/staticmatic preview .
</pre>

Now you can visit http://localhost:3000.

h2. Next Steps

Start customizing and adding to the existing Haml and Sass files to build your static website or prototype templates for your web application.
